# ;ðŸŽ€ berry-pretty-patterns ðŸŽ€;
This is a personal project created for my Web & Database Programming course.

The goal for this project is to create a website for knitters/crocheters/crafters to organize their own patterns, track project progress, and share finished works. Other users can see what patterns are in your library, but they will not be able to access that pattern

    - Sign up, log  in, log out
    - Profile customization (pfp, bio, knitter/crocheter/crafter)

4. **Monitor the progress:** Update the completion percentage, add notes, upload images
5. **Community Engagement:** (sharing complete projects, getting feedback, finding new ideas) //holding off on this for now
